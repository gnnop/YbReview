Dear Editor,

We would like to submit the attached review entitled “Rare-earth ion trap quantum computing: The current state of the art.”  Our intention is to offer a concise review of modern practice for readers with a basic knowledge of quantum computation, built around an analysis of a recent Honeywell computer. An independent review of the basic science, underlying technologies, and error characterization is presented, with particular emphasis on those aspects that are more generally applicable to quantum computation with rare-earth ions. 

We cover a broad range of relevant topics, ranging from ion trap design and qubit implementation through to the quantum information and computer science techniques that are used to assess the performance of the device, at a level designed to introduce the material to researchers from varying disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. While we do not go into great depth with any one of these fields, we aim to show how they are integrated in the actual implementation of a complete quantum computing device.


Sincerely,\\
Gavin N. Nop, Durga Paudyal, and Jonathan D.H. Smith
